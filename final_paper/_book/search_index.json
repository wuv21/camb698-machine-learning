Sections of this book will feature code and graphs produced using R as well. As will be discussed in the next chapter, the purpose of this paper is to introduce and broadly cover common machine learning techniques that are used in the biological sciences. Any included R code is for generating graphs and results to provide additional content in conveying the different techniques. As such, I opted to include the R code as a starting point for any readers who want to explore the techniques. The following code in this chapter are needed to load in additional software packages as well as to load in the data that will be used. library(tidyverse) library(usedist) library(qiimer) library(reshape2) library(ggplot2) library(ape) library(tree) library(Rtsne) library(class) library(randomForest) library(e1071) library(cluster) load(&quot;data/poop_across_penn1.Rdata&quot;) # Create vendor/mice dataframe s_vendor_all &lt;- s %&gt;% filter(grepl(&quot;ARC Vendor Experiment&quot;, Experiment)) %&gt;% rename(Vendor = Mouse_Source_Vendor) %&gt;% mutate(SubjectID = factor(paste(&quot;Mouse&quot;, Mouse_Number))) %&gt;% mutate(SampleType = trimws(as.character(SampleType))) %&gt;% arrange(SampleType, Vendor, SubjectID) # Identify and remove suspicious samples suspect_SampleIDs &lt;- c(&quot;Tac.33.CE.Day1&quot;, &quot;Env.13.Stool.Day0&quot;) # Set final dataframe s_vendor &lt;- s_vendor_all %&gt;% droplevels() %&gt;% filter(!(SampleID %in% suspect_SampleIDs)) "]

# Background {#bg}
From the initial raw data to visualizing the results, data processing and analysis are fundamental aspects of conducting scientific research. With the recent advances of high throughput technologies (i.e. the many “-omics”, multiparametric flow cytometry, etc.), the accompanying data is often high-dimensional and difficult for manual efforts to analyze. The development of machine learning methods aims to help with this problem, thus helping to make sense of the data to draw meaningful and accurate conclusions.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce and explore the different machine learning methods that are commonly used in the biological sciences. To help demonstrate the methods and to maintain the same context across all of the methods, a single dataset (will be referred to as the PAP dataset) was provided by the PennCHOP Microbiome Program (courtesy of Dr. Kyle Bittinger). Mice were purchased from vendors with the purpose of assessing whether the mice have different phenotypes from different vendors. The fecal microbiota was sequenced from the mice, resulting in a distance matrix (how distant each mouse’s microbiome was from the other mice sampled) as well as the relative abundance of bacterial species for each mouse. Additionally, metabolites as well as different immune phenotypes were assessed for each mouse. This high-dimensional dataset is representative of datasets that are seen with microbiome research.
